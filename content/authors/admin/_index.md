I am an undergraduate student at the School of Economics, Peking University. My academic interests focus on the intersection of economics, finance, and technology, especially in the emerging field of financial technology. Beyond academics, I enjoy reading, sports and music.

Throughout my undergraduate years, I have been fortunate to receive some valuable prizes and awards. For instance, I was the ‚ÄúStar of Organization‚Äù during the orientation camp for freshman. In addition, I was one of the most excellent students in our class. Last October, I won the championship of shuttlecock at the sports meeting, which showed my determination and perseverance.

In terms of leadership and service, I have served as the Learning Representative of my class, organizing academic support sessions for classmates, and I currently hold the position of Minister of the Organization Department at the School of Economics. These experiences have sharpened my organizational and communication abilities while deepening my sense of responsibility toward my peers.
